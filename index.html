                <h3>Webpage Creation</h3>
                <p>Webpage creation is the process of designing and building an individual page on the internet, typically as part of a larger website. It involves writing HTML for structure, applying CSS for styling, and often using JavaScript to add interactivity. The page is created with a focus on user experience, ensuring it's visually appealing, easy to navigate, and functional across different devices. After design and coding, the page is tested for performance and compatibility before being uploaded to a web server, making it accessible to users via a web browser.</p>
